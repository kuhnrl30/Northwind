# Northwind
Rpackage to distribut the data table from the Northwind sample database

The purpose of this package is to make the tables in the Northwind database available for demonstrating other techniques in R. 
The goal is that with other dataset available, we won't have to see so many tutorials using the Iris dataset. :)
